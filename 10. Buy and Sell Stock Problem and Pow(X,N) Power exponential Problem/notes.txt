Compute x^n
Binary exponentiation.
find x^n without running a loop n times. 
if a number is N in decimal -> it's binary form has log2base(n)+1 digits.
e.g. n=8 its binary form is 1000
so log2base(8)+1 = 3+1=4
steps:
1. first conver the power into binary form.
2. we will associate power with each binary digits x^1,x^2,x^4,x^8,x^16.......x^2n here x is the value we are given to find power of n.
3. ignore power values when the binary digit is 0 only multiply 1s
4. then multiply all the nonzero digit's powers
